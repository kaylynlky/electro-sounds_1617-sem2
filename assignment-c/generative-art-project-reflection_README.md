# Processing Exhibition Chosen:

- “Fluid Leaves”

# Aspect chosen:

- Geometric patterns, plants-like and organic

<b> Why I like this project?</b>

I chose Reinoud van Laar's Fluid Leaves because the entire system is unique with experimental elements. The project made use of libraries such as ControlP5. What I enjoy particularly is the <b><i>random replica of mixture of geometric</i></b> and algorithmic patterns which also incorporate experimental ideas to evolved the sketches better. He manipulates the initial simple geometric patterns (organic) transforms into different random algorithm forms with elements (noise). I was  mainly fascinated by the idea of "organic" forms of creative coding.


<b> How the project works technically?</b>

Reinoud van Laar describes Fluid Leaves as a generative approach pattern design which is inspired by the ingredients of the tea. He also experimented w noise and waveforms to create more organic forms of the veins of the leaf. He also experimented using displacement maps to break the shapes and texture of the leaves in order to create a more fluid dynamic sketch.

<b>Tried to imitate the above sketches of Leaves done:</b>

- hard to see the leaf vein and shape here, refer archive folder

<b><u>Final Sketch:</u></b>

- flower and petals, mainly usage of lines and ellipse

The sketch mainly uses geometric patterns, flower/petal-like shapes and leaves like shapes. Mainly the whole idea is plant or nature inspired. Sketch is going for a more organic feel. Manipulated the sketch to create different background textures and line textures, played with the code by trial and error, I personally like this sketch a lot.
