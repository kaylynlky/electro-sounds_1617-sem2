Results in varieties of patterns. (Best view in HD)  Music: Breathe (personal soundtrack)  Manipulated my own soundtrack, “Breathe” using Electro Acoustic MusicPrimer application. I re-created the song with different textures by using Pierre’s Playhouse project patch. Take notice of the variety of sound textures and dynamic range which was manipulated by LFO amplitude throughout the entire composition.
